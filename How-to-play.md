# HOW TO PLAY BLACKJACK/TWENTY-ONE

## OBJECT OF THE GAME

Participant attempts to beat the dealer by getting a count as close to 21 as possible, without going over 21.

## CARD VALUES/SCORING

It is up to the player if an ace is worth 1 or 11. Face cards (= J, Q, K) are 10 and any other card is its pip value.

## THE DEAL

The dealer gives one card face up to the player and then one card face up to themselves. Another round of cards is then dealt face up to the player, but the dealer takes the second card face down. Thus, the player receives two cards face up, and the dealer receives one card face up and one card face down.

## NATURALS

If the player's first two cards are an ace and a "ten-card" (a picture card or 10), giving a count of 21 in two cards, this is a natural or "blackjack." If the player has a natural and the dealer does not, the player wins. If the dealer has a natural, the dealer wins immediately.

If the dealer's face-up card is a ten-card or an ace, they look at their face-down card to see if the two cards make a natural. If the face-up card is not a ten-card or an ace, they do not look at the face-down card until it is the dealer's turn to play.

## THE PLAY (TODO)

The player to the left goes first and must decide whether to "stand" (not ask for another card) or "hit" (ask for another card in an attempt to get closer to a count of 21, or even hit 21 exactly). Thus, a player may stand on the two cards originally dealt to them, or they may ask the dealer for additional cards, one at a time, until deciding to stand on the total (if it is 21 or under), or goes "bust" (if it is over 21). In the latter case, the player loses and the dealer collects the bet wagered. The dealer then turns to the next player to their left and serves them in the same manner.

The combination of an ace with a card other than a ten-card is known as a "soft hand," because the player can count the ace as a 1 or 11, and either draw cards or not. For example with a "soft 17" (an ace and a 6), the total is 7 or 17. While a count of 17 is a good hand, the player may wish to draw for a higher total. If the draw creates a bust hand by counting the ace as an 11, the player simply counts the ace as a 1 and continues playing by standing or "hitting" (asking the dealer for additional cards, one at a time).
