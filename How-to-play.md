# HOW TO PLAY BLACKJACK/TWENTY-ONE

## OBJECT OF THE GAME

Each participant attempts to beat the dealer by getting a count as close to 21 as possible, without going over 21.

## CARD VALUES/SCORING

It is up to each individual player if an ace is worth 1 or 11. Face cards are 10 and any other card is its pip value.

## BETTING (to be implemented in v2.0)

Before the deal begins, each player places a bet, in chips, in front of them in the designated area. Minimum and maximum limits are established on the betting, and the general limits are from $2 to $500.

## THE DEAL

When all the players have placed their bets, the dealer gives one card face up to each player in rotation clockwise, and then one card face up to themselves. Another round of cards is then dealt face up to each player, but the dealer takes the second card face down. Thus, each player except the dealer receives two cards face up, and the dealer receives one card face up and one card face down.

In some games, played with only one deck, the players' cards are dealt face down and they get to hold them. Today, however, virtually all Blackjack games feature the players' cards dealt face up on the condition that no player may touch any cards.
